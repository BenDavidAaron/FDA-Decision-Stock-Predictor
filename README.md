# FDA-Decision-Stock-Predictor
This is my capstone project for [the Data Incubator Fellowship](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html). 
My goal is to take this project from initial concept to a usable application. 
### So Far:
1. I have found and scraped several investor news sites for past and upcoming FDA PDUFA (Prescription drug user fee act) action dates
1. I have munged the FDA announcement dates and joined them to stock price time-series for the relevant companies
1. I have sliced the relevant data into 120-day long preceding and following periods for data annotation and model training
1. I have annotated the data
### Upcoming:
1. Select and train a binary classification model, incorporating some time series fourier magic
1. Build and deploy a web application to track upcoming FDA action dates, and offer relevant investment insights (frankly, this _should_ have some sub-bullets, I anticipate it will be 1/2 of the work)
## End Goals:
* Train a machine learning model to recognize simple trends in the pharmaceutical equities market
* Learn web development the hard way
* Make a real project with a real repository on GitHub so I have something to demonstrate my skills beyond the awful scripts I wrote in graduate school

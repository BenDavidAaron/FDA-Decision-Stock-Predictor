    "Phase III clincial trials have a massive effect on the market captalizatizations of pharmaceutical companies. A successful phase III trial for a novel drug allows a company to begin marketing drugs to a previously unserved clinical indication, yielding large revenue streams. In order for a drug to pass it must pass through roughly 10 years of Research and be tested on thousands (or tens of thousands) of patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The long time scales of trials and the sheer numbers of people involved (patients, research scientists, clinicans, research coordinators, goverment regulators...), means that priveleged information regarding trial status has an unusally high level of exposure, compared to other high tech industries. [Recent research](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/103/20/1507/904625/Company-Stock-Prices-Before-and-After-Public) suggests that this information exposure can cause detectable movement in this public stock markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "If leaks of priveleged information can affect the valuations of pharmaceutical companies, can the movements of these valutaions be identified using Machine Learning and used to inform smarter trading decisions? "
